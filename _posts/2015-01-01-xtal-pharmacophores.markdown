A paper describing a novel pharmacophore method for G protein-coupled receptors has been published in *Methods*.

The method uses residue-ligand fragments from X-ray crystal structures to build pharmacophore models for GPCRs, and
even allows for modeling of receptors with no structural or ligand data available.
