A new paper is out in *Nucleic Acids Res.* that describes a major new release of [GPCRdb][gpcrdb].

The new release has been completely re-written and consolidated into an integrated system using Python 3, Django and
PostgeSQL.

GPCRdb is now open source and the [source code][source_code] and [source data][source_data] are available on BitBucket.
A virtual machine config for development is provided in the [documentation][docs], making it easy for anyone to start
contributing to the project.
