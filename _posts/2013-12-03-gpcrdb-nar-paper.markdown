A new paper is out in *Nucleic Acids Res*.

The paper describes an update to the [GPCRDB][gpcrdb], including novel alignments and models. In addition, a new
section of GPCRDB, GPCRDB Tools is now available. The tools provide new ways of visualizing and analyzing the data from
the GPCRDB, and allow for alignments and similarity calculations of subsets of sequences and sequence positions, well
as interactive diagrams that can be exported for publication.
