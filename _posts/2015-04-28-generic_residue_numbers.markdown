A paper on generic residue numbering schemes for GPCRs has been published in *Trends Pharmacol. Sci*.

The paper reviews commonly used generic numbering schemes, and introduces a novel, structure-based scheme that accounts
for structural irregularities revealed by recent GPCR crystal structures.

Complementary tools to look up generic numbers and number PDB structures can be found in [GPCRdb][gpcrdb].
