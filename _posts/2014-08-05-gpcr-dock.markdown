The results of GPCR Dock 2013 have been published.

GPCR Dock is a protein modeling evaluation where modelers around the world try to predict the structure of an upcoming
crystal structure of a G protein-coupled receptors in complex with ligands. In the 2013 evaluation, the structures were
of 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors 1B and 2B, and the smoothened receptor.

I participated as a member of the [Gloriam group][gloriamgroup], and our structural model of 5-HT1B ranked 1st in
overall protein structure, and 3rd in protein-ligand complex prediction.
